The original text works well as-is, but it can be tightened slightly for clarity and impact. The phrase "manually triaging these across" could be simplified to "manually triaging across," since "these" is already implied by the context. The parenthetical "Semantic Kernel/Claude Code" could be adjusted to "Semantic Kernel, Claude Code" for a cleaner list format. Additionally, "AI can instantly filter this noise" might read more naturally as "AI can instantly filter through this noise" to emphasize the process of sifting through the data. With these minor tweaks, the message becomes more concise and direct while retaining its urgency and technical precision.
